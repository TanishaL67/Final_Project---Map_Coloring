# Final_Project---Map_Coloring 
The Map Coloring Problem is a classic example of constraint satisfaction problem. 
The map-coloring constraint satisfaction problem requires that you assign a color to each region of a map such that any two regions sharing a border have different colors.
The constraints for the map-coloring problem can be expressed as follows:
1. Each region is assigned one color only, of possible colors.
2. The color assigned to one region cannot be assigned to adjacent regions.
# Objective:
Our goal for this project is to color a map of Canada with four different hues so that no two adjoining regions share the same shade. To resolve the map coloring issue, I will employ the four constraint satisfaction techniques Backtracking, Forward Search, Arc Consistency, and Local Search.
The results will be evaluated and the different algorithms will be compared on the bases of which performed the best for this problem set.
